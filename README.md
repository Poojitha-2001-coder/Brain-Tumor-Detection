# Brain Tumor Detection and Classification

This project focuses on the automated detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. The main objective is to extract and highlight the tumor in MRI images, identifying its location and boundary to assist medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Project Overview

This tool processes MRI scans to:
1. Extract and highlight the tumor area within brain MR images.
2. Provide visual information on the tumor's position and boundary, essential for diagnosis.
3. Detect the presence of tumors in the given MR images.

The system is designed to present relevant, easy-to-understand data to medical staff, supporting decision-making in patient care.
